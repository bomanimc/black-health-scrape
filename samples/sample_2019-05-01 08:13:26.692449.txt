Mar. 11, 2005 -- Genetics may be why U.S. black women tend to get more advanced breast cancer.
For example, black women begin puberty at younger ages, and they have higher rates of hormone-linked problems such as preterm birth, uterine fibroids and infertility than other groups of women.

The unidentified patient was working at an Ebola treatment unit in Sierra Leone when exposed to the highly lethal virus that has been ravaging four West African nations for months.

Because it is frequently misdiagnosed as plantar warts (on the soles of the feet), tinea manuum (a fungus occurring on the palms of the hands), or a condition known as talon noir or black heel, and because many people do not seek treatment early on, the melanoma death rate is highest among people with dark skin.
The results are based on follow-up of women who were part of the ongoing Black Women's Health Study.
