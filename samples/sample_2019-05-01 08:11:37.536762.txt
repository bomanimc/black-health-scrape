This disparity is captured in another statistic: 90% of white women, but only 78% of African-American women, survive at least five years after their breast cancer diagnosis.
African-American women may be more likely to die of breast cancer than women of other races, especially in the first few years after the diagnosis, according to new research.

First, black women in the U.S. and Africa had several things in common.

African-American Women and Breast Cancer

Among black women from 1986 to 1997, cancer incidence rose and mortality fell only slightly, whereas among white women incidence has remained relatively steady and mortality has dropped.
tPA is a little risky because a small subset of patients might get worse when given the drug, so it is possible that some doctors don't even offer the drug to their black patients, expecting that they'll refuse it.
"This study is a first step toward uncovering what harmful substances are in products frequently used by black women, so we can better understand what's driving some of the health issues they're facing," she added in an institute news release.
