THURSDAY, April 16, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- Blacks have a higher risk of developing prostate cancer than whites, and for obese black men, their risk can quadruple as their weight goes up, a new study indicates.
Part of the problem may be a lingering distrust in the black community of government sources of information and research.

African and black American women also tend to have more advanced breast cancers that aren't estrogen sensitive.
The findings showed that ACE inhibitors are less effective than other drugs for lowering blood pressure and preventing poor outcomes in African-Americans.
Blacks, in particular, are less likely to be given this potentially life saving drug.
Mar. 11, 2005 -- Genetics may be why U.S. black women tend to get more advanced breast cancer.
American Cancer Society chief medical officer Otis Brawley, MD, tells WebMD that the Albain study is not the first to suggest that poorer access does not completely explain the higher death rate among black patients for sex-related cancers.
"Perhaps African-American patients weren't counseled as effectively about what they could expect after treatment," he says.
For example, 30% of the children in studies in these areas were black despite this population only making up 15% of the U.S. population.

 SAMPLE 1:

The difference in death rates is “startlingly high” in Atlanta, where African-American women are dying of breast cancer at a rate more than double that of white women, according to the Avon Foundation, which funded the study.
However, given the ongoing debate about the value of routine prostate cancer screening, "this study identifies obese men, especially those of African ancestry, as a high-risk population who may particularly benefit from screening," Kutikov said.
Or it may be the recognized reality that African-Americans tend to have somewhat worse prostate cancer than patients of other races.
The CDC and other organizations are trying to shift ideas about HIV and AIDS so more black people feel safe talking about it and will get tested and treated.
HSV-2 prevalence was nearly twice as high among women (21%) as men (11%), and more than three times higher among African-Americans (39%) than whites (12%).

Around the same time as her public HIV test, King began working as a volunteer cheerleading coach and realized that mentoring young black and Latina girls was where her skills and passion could make the most difference.
Among the major findings:
The death rate during hospitalization for stroke was 5% among African-American patients and 7.4% among whites.
And since the background rate of infection is so high in the black community, African-American women are especially at risk, Douglas said.
"We can't definitively tell from these measurements that the change in their diet would have led to more cancer in the African group or less in the American group, but there is good evidence from other studies that the changes we observed are signs of cancer risk," study co-author Jeremy Nicholson of Imperial College London said in the news release.
The investigators estimated that 30 percent to 43 percent of black men develop preclinical prostate cancer (cancer without symptoms) by age 85.

If you're African-American, it's most likely to show up in your legs, bottom, or private parts.
Many black people may be HIV-positive and not know it, so they continue to spread the virus while also getting sicker.
I meet a whole lot of educated black women (with ER-positive tumors) who won't take tamoxifen because they hear that it hasn't been proven in African-Americans," Brawley says.
And there's a bunch of black women who don't get optimal therapy," he says.
It's easier for someone who has another sexually transmitted disease (STD), like gonorrhea, to get or pass HIV, and the infection rates for STDs are higher for African-Americans.
According to the latest findings:
Women and African-Americans were the most likely to be infected.
One problem is screening: Despite steady increases in mammography use by black women during the 1980s and 1990s, an article in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute in March 2000 said that black women are still less likely than white women to have access to low-cost screening programs where they live.
And although fewer white women are getting diagnosed with breast cancer,rates have remained stable among African-Americans.
I am willing to accept that men whose majority geographic heritage is from sub-Saharan Africa have a higher rate of prostate cancer, but that's separate from black men," Brawley said.
Discrimination appears to be a stressor that has particular relevance for the health of African-American women.

A range of issues contributes to disproportionate HIV risk for African-Americans, such as poverty, stigma, lack of access to health care, and higher rates of sexually transmitted diseases," Wolitski said at the news conference.
I meet a whole lot of educated black women (with ER-positive tumors) who won't take tamoxifen because they hear that it hasn't been proven in African-Americans," Brawley says.
Self-reported black race was associated with a more than twofold increase in food allergy risk.
The study team noted that blacks also face the highest risk for aggressive prostate cancer and death.
Among black women, approximately 22% of heart disease deaths from 1991-1995 were premature (before age 65), says the CDC.

It has been suggested that blacks have a higher incidence than whites of strokes caused by small vessel disease.
It's been less than a year since the last incidence of Ebola in the central African country.
But among the black study participants, three months of supplemental vitamin D was associated with a drop in systolic blood pressure (the top number in a blood pressure reading) of up to 4 mm Hg, the researchers found.
She and her colleagues discovered that when they looked at a national database, the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, to find the top reasons for visits to dermatologists by African-Americans.
Millions of Africans literally are dying for lack of AIDS drugs -- and U.S. national security depends on solving the dilemma, a leading American economist says in a keynote speech opening the 8th Annual Retrovirus Conference here.
Most African-American men and women get HIV when they don't use a condom or other protection when they have sex with a man.
No less alarming is the astonishingly heavy impact of HIV on African-American women, says Richard Wolitski, PhD, acting director of the CDC's division of HIV/AIDS prevention.
"Blackberries, raspberries, strawberries, and blueberries contain some phenolic acid phytochemicals," too, Magee adds.
The newly published study and others suggest that African-Americans are more likely than whites to have these life-sustaining interventions, but it is not clear if patients and family members are fully informed when they decide to have them.
According to NCI data, black women are more likely to be diagnosed with cancer before they are 40, when cancers are most aggressive; more likely to be diagnosed at an advanced stage; and less likely to survive five years after diagnosis.

TUESDAY, Oct. 21, 2014 (HealthDay News) -- Black women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) are only about half as likely as white women to become pregnant using the popular assisted reproduction technique, new research indicates, and the racial disparity persists even when donor eggs are used.
Survival among black women with breast cancer continues to lag well behind that of white women.
Black men were 27% less likely to get an ICD than were white men.
In 2014, only 59% of African-Americans living with HIV were taking medicine for it.
If you are African-American, Asian, Hawaiian, or Native American, melanoma is most likely to show up in your mouth, under your nails, or on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet.
March 9, 2010 -- One in six Americans between the ages of 14 and 49 have genital herpes and close to one in two black women are infected, new figures from the CDC reveal.
But some patients were even less likely to get an ICD than others:
Black women were 44% less likely to get an ICD than were white men.
But it could also be that there's actually a biological difference between African-American and non-Hispanic white men . . .
The CDC says that in 2016, four times as many black women were diagnosed with HIV than Hispanic or white women.

 SAMPLE 6:

Death rates among white women range from 21.7 per 100,000 in Hawaii to 27.3 in New Jersey; among African-American women they range from 20.9 in Rhode Island to 40.0 in Louisiana.
However, given the ongoing debate about the value of routine prostate cancer screening, "this study identifies obese men, especially those of African ancestry, as a high-risk population who may particularly benefit from screening," Kutikov said.
Other studies of the effects of vitamin D on blood pressure have been inconsistent and most studies have not included sufficient numbers of black men and women or studied higher doses of vitamin D, he said.
And it's more likely for a black man than a white man to get HIV by having sex with men.
Yes or No
Black women are more likely than white women to develop severe high blood pressure, as well as CHD, because they develop high blood pressure (hypertension) more often.
Children in poor families were also more likely to have never been diagnosed with asthma (16%) than those in families that were not poor (11%), and non-Hispanic black children were twice as likely to have had an asthma attack in the last year when compared with Hispanic children.

That higher risk of death was driven by African-American women who had estrogen receptor-positive tumors, she found.
Because black women have higher incidences of such conditions, the scientists compared black and white egg donor recipients who had similar uterine histories.
While there was no significant difference in death risk, researchers did find that black soldiers with sickle cell trait were 54 percent more likely than their counterparts without the trait to suffer exertional rhabdomyolysis.
Part of the problem may be a lingering distrust in the black community of government sources of information and research.
On average, black women are diagnosed at 57, compared to 63 for white women, says the study.
Hispanic children were two to four times more likely to lack a usual place for health care compared with black or white children (12% vs. 5% and 3%, respectively).
The number of new HIV infections among young black men who have sex with men is alarming," Kevin Fenton, MD, PhD, director of the CDC's division of HIV/AIDS, said at a news conference held to announce the findings.
But he does not accept Albain’s assertion that there must be genetic or biologic differences between black and white cancer patients that affect cancer survival.
While 60% of African-American women said their hair was too dry, 67% of Caucasian women said their hair had normal moisture.

We still don't know how much of this risk is attributable to African ancestry and genetic heritage and how much is due to other causes," he tells WebMD.
Much of the risk for diabetes among the African American population can be modified with lifestyle changes, but a yet-unknown genetic or environmental factor may also contribute.
Because of this, the American Heart Association and other health groups recommend more aggressive blood pressure treatment for African-Americans than for other racial groups.
African-American hair isn't just very kinky, coarse texture," says LaVar, who has worked with celebrities including Angela Bassett, Naomi Campbell, Whitney Houston, Iman, Serena Williams, Venus Williams, and Oprah.
And since the background rate of infection is so high in the black community, African-American women are especially at risk, Douglas said.
Black Americans are at greater risk of high blood pressure than whites, and a new study suggests the "Southern" diet bears much of the blame.
The ongoing Black Women's Health Study includes 59,001 African-American women from all parts of the U.S.
It's usually curable, but it's often more serious in African-Americans.

Black Americans who take vitamin D supplements may significantly lower their blood pressure, a new study suggests.
After adjusting for body mass index (BMI -- an estimate of body fat based on height and weight) and lifestyle factors such as diet and smoking, the researchers found that black women who worked night shifts for 10 or more years still had a 23 percent increased risk of developing diabetes.
Because it is frequently misdiagnosed as plantar warts (on the soles of the feet), tinea manuum (a fungus occurring on the palms of the hands), or a condition known as talon noir or black heel, and because many people do not seek treatment early on, the melanoma death rate is highest among people with dark skin.
”
Brawley says the research convinces him that if access to medical care were equal and more emphasis was placed on preventive care, the cancer survival disparity between blacks and whites would largely disappear.
Experts have long known that blacks are more likely to die of heart disease and stroke than whites -- and that rates of high blood pressure explain a lot of that disparity.
In America, more black women than whites are diagnosed with breast cancer before age 45.
