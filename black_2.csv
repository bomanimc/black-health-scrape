","While black women are less likely than white women to get breast cancer, they are much more likely to die from it.",
"https://www.webmd.com/breast-cancer/features/battling-breast-cancer
","A study by National Cancer Institute (NCI) researchers, published in the journal Archives of Family Medicine in November 1999, revealed an alarming increase in the already troubling gap between black and white mortality rates due to breast cancer, from 16% in 1990 to 29% in 1995.",
"https://www.webmd.com/breast-cancer/features/battling-breast-cancer
","And the NCI data show that the five-year survival rate for black women with breast cancer is 71%, compared with 87% for white women.",
"https://www.webmd.com/breast-cancer/features/battling-breast-cancer
",Experts have traditionally explained the discrepancy between black and white survival rates by noting that black women tend not to seek help until their cancers are already at an advanced stage.,
"https://www.webmd.com/breast-cancer/features/battling-breast-cancer
","But the authors of the NCI report found that mortality among black women during the 1960s and 1970s was actually lower compared with that of whites until 1981, when mortality for whites began to drop sharply in response to more aggressive screening programs and better chemotherapy protocols.",
"https://www.webmd.com/breast-cancer/features/battling-breast-cancer
","And that leads to a disturbing conclusion, says Otis Brawley, MD, one of the study's authors: That black women have somehow been cheated out of the advances that have taken place over the past 20 years in mammography, chemotherapy, and powerhouse drugs such as tamoxifen.",
"https://www.webmd.com/breast-cancer/features/battling-breast-cancer
",Brawley blames poor access to health care and lower standards of care for black women.,
"https://www.webmd.com/breast-cancer/features/battling-breast-cancer
",A lot of black women do not get nearly as good treatment for breast cancer as do white women.,
"https://www.webmd.com/breast-cancer/features/battling-breast-cancer
","One problem is screening: Despite steady increases in mammography use by black women during the 1980s and 1990s, an article in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute in March 2000 said that black women are still less likely than white women to have access to low-cost screening programs where they live.",

","When you look at the biology of the tumors that are often found in African-American women, the tumors are a little bit more aggressive, and the cell types are much more atypical than (those of) the average white woman,"" says Charles J. McDonald, MD, a cancer specialist and immediate past president of the American Cancer Society (ACS).",
"https://www.webmd.com/breast-cancer/features/battling-breast-cancer
","Heredity also appears to play a role in why black women get cancer at a younger age, he says.",
"https://www.webmd.com/breast-cancer/features/battling-breast-cancer
","According to NCI data, black women are more likely to be diagnosed with cancer before they are 40, when cancers are most aggressive; more likely to be diagnosed at an advanced stage; and less likely to survive five years after diagnosis.",
"https://www.webmd.com/breast-cancer/features/battling-breast-cancer
","Clinical studies report that black women also are up to twice as likely to be diagnosed with breast cancers that are estrogen-receptor (ER) negative, meaning they resist popular estrogen-blocking drugs, such as tamoxifen, which work by starving ER-positive tumors of the hormone they need to grow.",
"https://www.webmd.com/breast-cancer/features/battling-breast-cancer
","Among black women from 1986 to 1997, cancer incidence rose and mortality fell only slightly, whereas among white women incidence has remained relatively steady and mortality has dropped.",
"https://www.webmd.com/breast-cancer/features/battling-breast-cancer
","While unequal access to health care and poor quality of care are often cited as the reasons behind these numbers, it is tumor biology -- the idea that there may actually be a ""black"" breast cancer that strikes earlier and grows faster -- that prompts the most fear among black women.",
"https://www.webmd.com/breast-cancer/features/battling-breast-cancer
","And there's a bunch of black women who don't get optimal therapy,"" he says.",
"https://www.webmd.com/breast-cancer/features/battling-breast-cancer
","The fact that black mortality rates have stubbornly refused to drop in recent years, Brawley says, could be due to higher rates of poverty and obesity among black women, which make them more likely to develop cancers as well as less likely to get good care.",
"https://www.webmd.com/breast-cancer/features/battling-breast-cancer
