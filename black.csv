TUESDAY, Oct. 21, 2014 (HealthDay News) -- Black women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) are only about half as likely as white women to become pregnant using the popular assisted reproduction technique, new research indicates, and the racial disparity persists even when donor eggs are used."
"https://www.webmd.com/infertility-and-reproduction/news/20141021/black-women-fare-worse-with-fertility-treatments-study-says
","In the study, about 31 percent of white patients became pregnant after IVF, compared to about 17 percent of black patients."
"https://www.webmd.com/infertility-and-reproduction/news/20141021/black-women-fare-worse-with-fertility-treatments-study-says
","Analyzing more than 4,000 IVF cycles over two years to tease out the impact of race, scientists from University of Chicago also found that miscarriage after IVF -- where eggs and sperm are joined in a lab and implanted in the woman's uterus -- occurred twice as often among blacks than whites."

","In another study being presented at the ASRM meeting, researchers from Columbia University Medical Center in New York found that racial differences for IVF success persisted between white and black women even when donor eggs were used."
"https://www.webmd.com/infertility-and-reproduction/news/20141021/black-women-fare-worse-with-fertility-treatments-study-says
","Because black women have higher incidences of such conditions, the scientists compared black and white egg donor recipients who had similar uterine histories."
"https://www.webmd.com/infertility-and-reproduction/news/20141021/black-women-fare-worse-with-fertility-treatments-study-says
